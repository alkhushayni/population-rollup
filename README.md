# population-rollup
Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
<br />
<br />
In this challenge, I dropped the missing values directly.
<br />
For the part of calculating average population percent change (PPCHG), I dropped the rows that contain 0 values in the year of 2000. 
<br />
The python version I used in this challenge is python 3.8, and the package/library I used is pandas.
<br />
I cannot pass your tester because it gave me the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'", which means that your tester service does not support pandas I think.
