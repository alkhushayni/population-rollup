# population-rollup
Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
<br />
<br />
1. In this challenge, I dropped the missing values directly.
<br />
2. For the part of calculating average population percent change (PPCHG), I dropped the rows that contain 0 values in the year of 2000. 
<br />
3. The python version I used in this challenge is python 3.8, and the package/library I used is pandas.
<br />
4. I cannot pass your tester because it gave me the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'", which means that your tester service does not support pandas I think.
<br />
5. I did three tests locally, and I provided the results in the directory "insight_testsuite/tests", and I provided the result with the input of the whole dataset as my fourth try.
